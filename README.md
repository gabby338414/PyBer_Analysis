## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
* For Rural areas they could more options for future employees that don't have a car, they could provide them with one and deducted a certain amount from each check. The Suburan average fare is high they could offer promotions to frequent riders. And for Urban they can offer promotions for drivers that will help increase pay.
